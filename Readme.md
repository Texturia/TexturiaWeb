Product Name: Texturia

Texturia is a mobile app and website that allows users to take a picture of any object or element of nature (eg, tree, leaf, rock, etc), and the app extracts the colour, design, and apparent texture of the object. That design can then be saved and applied to a custom-designed household object or decor (custom sweater, shoe, wallpaper, rug, etc). Afterwards, users can use AR to see what the objects they designed would look like in their home, or wherever they wish to place the object. 

Product designers/manufacturers can register their business through our platform to bring the designed creations to life. Users can then purchase their custom-designed product from one of the registered designers (of which Texturia keeps a percentage of sales)

Additional Product Features:
    Editing, cropping, and warping the extracted design to better fit the designed product
    Sharing their creations directly with other users or posting them in public communities
    Posting reviews for ordered products
