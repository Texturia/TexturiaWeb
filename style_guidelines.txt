==================================
Overall Look and Feel of Texturia 
==================================

The overall look and feel should be simplistic and eloquent. This will be achieved through the use of a simple colour palette, padding around elements, and a lack of 3d elements and shadows. The elements should also be well defined, avoiding soft or rounded edges. Overall, it should show sophistication and elegance to the user.   

========
Colours
========

For Texturia, a black and white colour scheme was chosen, also including a couple of shades of gray. The darker colours help create a more powerful impact of the elegant designs, while the lighter grayish-white aid in establishing a modern atmosphere. The occasional use of light blue (navbar, link) helps energize the brand.

Iconography
============

The logo will serve as an icon taking the user to the Home screen. It will fit in with our desired colour scheme of black and white, maintaining the simplicity and elegance of our overall look and feel.

Typography

We will be using Roboto from Google Fonts.

Links

Link color:  #99ddff


The ‘Back to Top’ link will be fixed onto the page but will not change colour when the user hovers over it.

Buttons

Buttons will have a flat, rectangular design with letters on the button capitalized. On-hover, the background will change to light blue. They won’t have any shadow effects.
